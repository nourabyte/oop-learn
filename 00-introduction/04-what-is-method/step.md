# Step 04: What Is Methods
Collection of instructions that performs a specific task.
## Concept
>Method is a **block of code** that performs a specific task.

We write a **method** once and use it many times
- `Defining Method`: provides information about modifier,return type, name, parameter list(), 
 and a body between braces, {}.
  ```java
  public double calculatediv(double numberOne, int numberTwo) {
  }
  ```
  
 - `Return type`: data type of the value returned by the method or void if does not return a value. It is **mandatory** in syntax.
 - `Naming Method`: should be a verb in lowercase or a multi-word name that begins with a verb in lowercase, has a unique name within its class. It is **mandatory** in syntax.
 - `Parameter list`: comma-separated list of the **input parameters is defined**, preceded by their data type, if there are no parameters, you must use **empty parentheses ()**.  It is **optional** in syntax.

## Example
```java
