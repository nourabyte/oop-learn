# Step 05: Four Main Principles Of Object Oriented Programming
Design and organization of `classes` and `objects` to achieve desirable software characteristics such as **modularity, reusability, and maintainability.**

## Concept
These **principles** work together to provide the **foundation** for oop. By utilizing `encapsulation`, `inheritance`, `polymorphism`, and `abstraction`

## Example
```
1. Inheritance: allows new classes to inherit properties and methods from existing ones, promoting code reusability.
2. Encapsulation: involves bundling data and methods within a class, keeping them organized and secure.
3. Polymorphism: lets objects of different classes be treated as objects of a common class, enhancing flexibility in code.
4. Abstraction: simplifies complex systems by focusing on essential features and hiding unnecessary details, making it easier to understand and maintain code.
```
