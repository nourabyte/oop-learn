# Step 05: Override method
Allows a `subclass` to provide a different implementation of a method that is already defined in its `superclass`.

## Concept
When a **subclass** `overrides` a method, it provides a new implementation of that method with the **same signature** (name, return type, and parameters) as the method in the **superclass**. The subclass can modify the behavior of the method to suit its specific requirements.

Use the `@Override` annotation when overriding a method, this annotation informs the compiler that the intention is to override a method, and it helps catch errors if the method signature does not match any method in the superclass.
