# Step 02: What is an object in oop

imagine you are a student, you have an `Attribute` like student ID, name and courses and `action`like adding course ,deleting course and searching, and each students have same attributes but unique identity.

## Concept

Object can be anything like pen,computer, etc. If there are objects then they will have Attribute and action(methods),
which will differentiate one object from other.

 - Attributes: the object what properties it has.
 - Methods: what the object does.
   
So object encapsulate both attributes and methods related to that entity, allowing for structured and modular code organization.

## Example

object: car
attribute: color, brand, weight, model.
action: break, accelerate, turn, change gears.
