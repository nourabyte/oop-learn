imagine you are a student, you have an `Attribute` like student ID, name and courses and `action`like adding course, deleting course, and each students have same attributes but unique identity.

Object encapsulate both attributes and methods related to that entity, allowing for structured and modular code organization.

 - Attributes: the object what properties it has.
 - Methods: what the object does.

action: break, accelerate, turn.
```
