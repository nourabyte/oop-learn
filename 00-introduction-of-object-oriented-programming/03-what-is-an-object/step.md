# Step 03: What Is An Object In Object Oriented Programming 
Let's imagine you are a student. As a student, you have specific attributes such as a student ID, name, and a list of courses. You can perform various actions related to these attributes, such as adding a course to your list or deleting a course. So every object have attribute and action(method).

## Concept
> object =  attributes + actions

xxxx

> name = value

> object =  variables + methods

`Object` is a **copy** of `Class`. Each **object created from the class** will have its own set of **attribute values**, and the **methods** defined in the class can be invoked on **individual objects** to perform **specific actions**.


## Example
```
object: car
attribute: color, brand, model.
action: break, accelerate, turn.
```
