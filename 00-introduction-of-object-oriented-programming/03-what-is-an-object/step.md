# Step 03: What Is An Object In OOP
Let's imagine you are a student. As a student, you have specific attributes such as a student ID, name, and grade . You can perform various actions related to these attributes, such as searching for a grade or . So every object have attribute and action(method).

## Concept
> object =  attributes + actions

`Attributes` represent the **state or properties** of the `object`.
> attributes = name and value

`actions` are performed by invoking **methods** on the object.
> object =  variables + methods

`Object` is a **copy** of `Class`. Each **object created from the class** will have its own set of **attribute values**, and the **action(**methods**)** defined in the class can be invoked on **individual objects** to perform **specific actions**.


## Example
```
object: car
attribute: color, brand, model.
action: break, accelerate, turn.
```
