# Step 02: What is an object in oop 
Let's imagine you are a student. As a student, you have specific attributes such as a student ID, name, and a list of courses. You can perform various actions related to these attributes, such as adding a course to your list or deleting a course. So every object have attribute and action(method).

## Concept

**Object** is a **copy** of `Class`. Each **object** created from the class will have its own set of **attribute** **values**, and the **methods** defined in the **class** can be invoked on individual objects to perform **specific actions** based on their distinct attribute values.

Object is a copy of the class. Each object created from the class possesses its own set of attribute values, unique to that object. Additionally, the methods defined within the class can be invoked on individual objects, enabling them to perform specific actions that depend on their distinct attribute values.
## Example
```
object: car
attribute: color, brand, model.
action: break, accelerate, turn.
```
