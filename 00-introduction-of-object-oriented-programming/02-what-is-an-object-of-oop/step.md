# Step 02: What is an object in oop
Imagine you are a **student**, you have an `Attribute` like student ID, name and courses and `action` like adding course, deleting course. 

Let's imagine you are a student. As a student, you have specific attributes such as a student ID, name, and a list of courses. You can perform various actions related to these attributes, such as adding a course to your list or deleting a course.

## Concept

**Object** is a **copy** of `Class`. Each **object** created from the class will have its own set of **attribute** **values**, and the **methods** defined in the **class** can be invoked on individual objects to perform **specific actions** based on their distinct attribute values.

## Example
```
object: car
attribute: color, brand, model.
action: break, accelerate, turn.
```
