# Step 02: What Is A Class
`Class` is a **blueprint** from which objects are created.

## Concept
A`class` describe all **properties** and **behaviours** that an object can have. It define `attribute`, which represent the **properties** or **characteristics** of the `object`, as well as the `method`, which represent the **actions** or **behaviors** that the **objects can perform**.

## Example

```java
/* 1. Create new class by using (class) keyword. */
public class Student {
 /* 2. Attributes*/
    public String name;
    public int age;
    public int gradeLevel;

/* 3. Method */
    public void attendence() {
    }
}
```
## Practice
1. Create a class named Car with the following attributes: brand, color and year.
2. Create method named is turn.
