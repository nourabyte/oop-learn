# Step 04: What Is Access Modifiers
`Access modifier` is the **accessibility or visibility** of class, method, variable within a program.
## Concept
1. `Public` is accessible from **anywhere** in the program.
   
3. `Private` is accessible within the **same class only**.
   
3. `Protected` is accessible within the **same class**, **subclasses**, and **same package.**
   
5. `Default` is accessible within the same package only.
   - When no access modifier is specified (i.e., no public, private, or protected), the default access modifier is applied.
