# Step 02: What is the structure of object oriented programming

imagine you are a student, you have an `Attributes` like student ID, name and courses and `actions(method)`like adding course ,deleting course and searching, and each students have same information.

how we can implement in **object oriented**?

## Concept

So in the previous scenario, we need a class represent all students beacuse the **class** is blueprint/template that describes the details of an students.
each student have unique attribute values it's should be separate student information to you can handle 



we create the **object** student with set of attribute values and the "deletingCourse" method could remove a course from the student's schedule (class).
The class Itâ€™s describes the details of an object .
