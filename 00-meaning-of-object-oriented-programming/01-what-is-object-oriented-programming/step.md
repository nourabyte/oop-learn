# Step 01: What is object oriented programming

## Concept
In computer science, object-oriented programming **OOP** is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concepts of `classes` and `objects`, it's used to `structure` software programs into simple, reusable pieces of code known as classes. These classes serve as blueprints for creating individual instances of objects.
## Example
```java
//class creation

public class Number {

int y = 10;

public static void main(String[] args) {

//object creation

Number Obj1 = new Number(); 

System.out.println(Obj1.y);

}
}
```
