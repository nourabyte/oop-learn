# Step 01: What is object oriented programming
  > OOP is that it helps to organize your code in a logical and modular way.

## Concept
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming methodology that revolves around the concepts of `classes` and `objects`. It is used to structure software programs into simple, reusable pieces of code known as classes. These classes serve as blueprints or templates for creating individual instances of objects.

## Example
```java
//class creation

public class Number {

int y = 10;

public static void main(String[] args) {

//object creation

Number Obj1 = new Number(); 

System.out.println(Obj1.y);

}
}
```

## Practice

1- After you understanding the previous example, try to creating an object that returns the number 9.
