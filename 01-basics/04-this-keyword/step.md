# Step 04: This Keyword
Keyword about the behaviour and state of an object or instance related to the class.
## Concept
`This` reference to the current **instance/object** in a **method or constructor**. Itâ€™s most common use is to discard the confusion between class **attributes and parameters with the same name**.

you can use this to access other methods or fields within the same object. It helps distinguish between local variables and instance variables when they have the same name.

this keyword allows objects to refer to themselves, access their own members, differentiate between local and instance variables, and enable constructor chaining. 
It's a way for objects to talk about themselves and work with their own properties and behavior.
